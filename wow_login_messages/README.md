# `wow_login_messages`

Implementation of the network protocol used between World of Warcraft [authentication/login](https://wowdev.wiki/Login_Packet) servers and clients for game versions 1.0.0 (Vanilla) to 3.3.5 (Wrath of the Lich King).
See the [WoWDev Login page](https://wowdev.wiki/Login) for details.

## Usage

To add only the synchronous methods add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
wow_login_messages = { version = "0.1", features = ["sync"] }
```

Or add it with [cargo edit](https://github.com/killercup/cargo-edit):
```bash
cargo add --features 'sync' wow_login_messages
```

For `async` support see the Features section.

And then [check out the docs](https://docs.rs/wow_srp/latest/wow_login_messages/).

## Features

Tokio and async-std support are gated behind the `tokio` and `async-std` features.
Synchronous (std) support is gated behind `sync`.
All of these are disabled by default.
You must enable at least one of them, otherwise there's not much point to the crate.

## Auto Generation

This crate is partially auto generated by the `wowm` files in the [`wow_messages` repository](https://github.com/gtker/wow_messages/).

## Design Decisions

Types have been named the ugly `CMD_SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` way because that's
what other (mostly C++) emulators call them. This makes it significantly easier
to search through other emulators or other documentation.

## Other Work

* [vMaNGOS (C++)](https://github.com/vmangos/core/blob/ce164f3eb32c75b244482070fbaf3ada1110e6be/src/realmd/AuthSocket.cpp#L65)
and MaNGOS derivatives in general have a relatively complete list of messages for popular versions,
but they are not available as a library.
* [Ember (C++)](https://github.com/EmberEmu/Ember/blob/418aaac1d32a65384cfb399c97640c1f25afa69c/src/login/grunt/client/LoginChallenge.h#L37)
has all messages for 1.12, although some work will probably be required in order to use it as a standalone library.
* [Shadowburn (Erlang)](https://gitlab.com/shadowburn/shadowburn/-/blob/ac905fabf56579b3bda6f16689c74f544da043e2/apps/logind/lib/authenticator.ex#L173)
has messages for 1.12, although they are not in the form of a library.
* [gophercraft (Go)](https://github.com/superp00t/gophercraft/blob/382259f45bc9bfc4209af87ae1cd174d76fd4ce2/auth/AuthLogonChallenge_C.go#L13)
seems to have most messages in a library format.
