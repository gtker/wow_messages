# MSG_MOVE_WORLDPORT_ACK

## Client Version 1, Client Version 2, Client Version 3

Acknowledge from the client that it has received an [SMSG_NEW_WORLD](./smsg_new_world.md) and has loaded the new map.

Despite the name this seems to only be sent by the client.

The server should reply with what it normally does to log players into the world.
