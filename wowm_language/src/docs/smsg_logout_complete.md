# SMSG_LOGOUT_COMPLETE

## Client Version 1.12, Client Version 2, Client Version 3

### Description

Immediately logs out the client of the world and makes it send [CMSG_CHAR_ENUM](./cmsg_char_enum.md).

Normally the client will send [CMSG_LOGOUT_REQUEST](./cmsg_logout_request.md) and the server will reply with an [SMSG_LOGOUT_RESPONSE](./smsg_logout_response.md) before this message, but sending it unprompted will also immediately send the client to the character screen.

### Comment

The client always seems to send 2 [CMSG_CANCEL_TRADE](./cmsg_cancel_trade.md) immediately after receiving this mesage, but before sending [CMSG_CHAR_ENUM](./cmsg_char_enum.md).

Even if 'Exit Game' is selected the client will still send a [CMSG_CHAR_ENUM](./cmsg_char_enum.md) immediately before closing the connection, despite it not needing to see the character list.
