# `u48`

A `u32` followed by a `u16`.
This is a workaround to `MovementFlags` for 3.3.5 requiring control flow from both a `u32` and a separate `u16`,
which complicates the implementation.

The lower 32 bits (4 bytes) are sent first as little endian, then followed by the upper 16 bits (2 bytes) as little endian.
