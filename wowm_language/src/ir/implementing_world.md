# Implementing world messages

If you have [autogenerated the login messages](./implementing_login.md) you will have a reasonable base for proceeding with the world messages, however this is not a requirement.

The world message data can be found in
the [`intermediate_representation.json`](https://github.com/gtker/wow_messages/blob/main/intermediate_representation.json)
file.
The [`intermediate_representation_schema.json`](https://github.com/gtker/wow_messages/blob/main/intermediate_representation_schema.json)
contains a [JSON type def](https://jsontypedef.com/) schema for the `intermediate_representation.json`.
The [`json-typedef-codegen`](https://github.com/jsontypedef/json-typedef-codegen) program can be used to generate
bindings for many popular languages.

The [`wow_messages_python` repository](https://github.com/gtker/wow_messages_python) contains the Python code used to
generate the Python message library.
It can be used as inspiration for your own implementation.
The [`generator` directory](https://github.com/gtker/wow_messages_python/tree/main/generator) contains the actual code
generation,
and the [`wow_world_messages` directory](https://github.com/gtker/wow_messages_python/tree/main/wow_world_messages)
contains the generated library.

Python code will be shown in this document to provide examples of how libraries could be implemented.
If you want to use the Python library then just bypass this and
[use the library directly](https://github.com/gtker/wow_messages_python/) instead.

## Message Layout

For Vanilla and TBC, all messages start with a 2 byte **big endian** size field.

For Wrath, all messages from the client (`CMSG`) start with a 2 byte **big endian** size field,
but at some unknown point in Wrath the possibility of having `SMSG` with 3 byte opcode was added.
If the most significant (first) byte of the size field has the most significant bit set
(that is, `first_size_byte & 0x80 != 0`) the size field is 3 bytes instead of 2.
When sending messages from the server you must handle this special case for messages that are larger than `0x7FF` bytes.

For all versions, messages sent from the server (`SMSG`) have a 2 byte opcode field and messages sent
from the client (`CMSG`) have a 4 byte opcode field.

For all versions, the size field contains the size of the opcode field and the size of the remaining message body.

So in the case of the `CMSG_PLAYER_LOGIN` message:

```rust,ignore
test CMSG_PLAYER_LOGIN {
    guid = 0xDEADBEEF;
} [
    0x00, 0x0C, /* size */
    0x3D, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, /* opcode */
    0xEF, 0xBE, 0xAD, 0xDE, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, /* guid */
]
```

Has a single `Guid` field (of 8 bytes), but the reported size is `0x0C`/`12` because it includes the 4 byte opcode
field.

## Encryption

`SMSG_AUTH_CHALLENGE` and `CMSG_AUTH_RESPONSE` are sent in plain text and used to negotiate a simple header
encryption based on the session key.
It is [described in detail for 1.12 in this blog post](https://gtker.com/implementation-guide-for-the-world-of-warcraft-flavor-of-srp6/#world-packet-header-encryption)
The [`wow_srp`](https://github.com/gtker/wow_srp) library written in Rust has implementations for Vanilla (1.12), TBC (2.4.3), and Wrath (3.3.5).

`CMSG_PING` and `SMSG_PONG` can also be sent unencrypted if the client has not yet received a reply to `CMSG_AUTH_SESSION`.
These four messages are the only messages that can be sent unencrypted.


## Types used for login messages

World messages use the following types, including enums, flags, and structs:

## Library layout

Consider what you want the layout of the library to look like regarding files and directories.

You will likely want to limit yourself to a limited set of client versions such as Vanilla (1.12), TBC (2.4.3), and Wrath (3.3.5).

The exact layout of your library will depend on the scope.
For the Python library I decided to have a single `wow_world_messages` package with a module each for Vanilla, TBC, and Wrath.

This is the layout of the Python library:

```text
├── README.md
└── wow_world_messages
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── wrath.py
    ├── tbc.py
    ├── util.py
    └── vanilla.py
```
