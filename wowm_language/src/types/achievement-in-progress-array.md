# AchievementInProgressArray

Array of [AchievementInProgress](../docs/achievementinprogress.md) structs that, like
the [AchievementDoneArray](achievement-done-array.md), does not have a size variable but instead terminates if
the `achievement` value is `-1`.

`AchievementInProgressArray` is only for Wrath.
